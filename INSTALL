Installing DVBlast
==================

No autotools yet... You have to tweak the Makefile by hand, especially
if your kernel is S2API-enabled but not your distribution (indicate the
path of your kernel where appropriate). Compile the program with `make`
and install with `make install`. It requires the installation of libdvbpsi
and libdvbpsi-devel (depending on your distribution).
