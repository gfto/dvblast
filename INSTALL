Installing DVBlast
==================

Compile the program with `make` and install with `make install`. Your
kernel must support DVB S2API which was merged in Linux 2.6.28 and released
on 24 Dec 2008.

DVBlast 2.X no longer requires libdvbpsi runtime and libdvbpsi-devel for
compilation. Instead you must install biTStream on your build machine (no
runtime library is needed).

To install biTStream, clone git repository and run `make install`.

    git clone git://git.videolan.org/bitstream.git
    cd bitstream
    make install

If you wish to support Deltacast ASI cards, you will first need to install
the Deltacast StreamMaster drivers and SDK, which are downloadable from the
Deltacast website (login required).
